        <p>On this page I will explain what Html and Css is.Hypertext markup 
          language or Html is used for  
         designing online websites and also configure them.It is used to
        import codes or text that will be seen on the website. you can put
        pictures,videos and many other things using html.It is used for putting
        text in the body and header.Casacading style sheet or Css is used for 
        designing the website with colors,pictures and many more.Mostly every
        web designer uses this style designer on their website.This is the
        reason why you see all these websites with a bunch of creativity.Css is
        one of the most powerful tools to use because it is used to create and 
        style a web page.

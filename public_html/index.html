                <h2>My name is Kaelen Juntilla </h2>
                <!--here I explain about myself-->
                <p>I am into many things not just coding but also into pc gaming and 
                    sports.There are many different genres of games that I 
                    like from Action to fighting to even strategy games.
                    You can't be a coder without have played a game.Gaming is 
                    all about coding, because games have about millions of lines
                    of code especially the big ones like call of duty and 
                    skyrim.Sports everybody has one,mine is soccer.
                    Soccer is fun for me because you use your legs more than
                    hands.I also have a hobby it may not be that known to people
                    but it is called airsofting.It is  where you use bb guns to
                    get other players there is a video at the bottom

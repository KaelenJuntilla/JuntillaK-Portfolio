                <h2>My name is Kaelen Juntilla </h2>
                <p>I am into many things not just coding but also into pc gaming and 
                    sports.<br />There are many different genres of games that I 
                    like from Action to fighting <br />to even strategy games.
                    You can't be a coder without have played a game.<br />Gaming is 
                    all about coding, because games have about millions of lines
                    <br />of code especially the big ones like call of duty and 
                    skyrim.Sports <br />everybody has one,mine is soccer.
                    Soccer is fun for me because <br />you use your legs more than
                    hands.I also have a hobby it may not<br /> be that known to people
                    but it is called airsofting.
